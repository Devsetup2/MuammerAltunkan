            <h1> First commercial biological computer powered by human brain cells</h1>
            <p>Australian startup Cortical Labs has introduced the world's first commercial biological computer powered by human brain cells. The system, called CL1, offers information processing capability by combining biological neurons with silicon chips.
                Unlike artificial intelligence, the technology, which consumes less energy and has fast learning capability, paves the way for new applications in the fields of medicine and informatics. Cortical Labs pointed out that CL1 can contribute to the development of new drugs and disease diagnosis.
                CL1, which works with a special support system that keeps the cells grown in the laboratory environment alive, will be produced on order for research centres and scientific studies.</p>
                
            <p>Cortical Labs has launched CL1, the world's first commercial biological computer based on neurons grown from human stem cells. Introduced at the MWC conference in Barcelona, CL1 represents a new type of artificial intelligence called ‘Synthetic Biological Intelligence’ (SBI).

                This system draws attention as a computer that consumes less energy, continuously learns and works with biological neural networks.
                
                CL1: The Meeting of Biological Intelligence and Computer Technology
                Cortical Labs aims to create a more sustainable and flexible artificial intelligence model using biological brain cells with this technology, which it has been developing for six years.
                
                In this system
                
                Hundreds of thousands of laboratory-produced neurons are placed on silicon chips.
                These cells work with electrical signals and are capable of continuous learning.
                Unlike classical artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, energy consumption is much lower.
                Neurons are combined in a culture dish to form new connections, just like in the human brain.
                Dr Brett Kagan, Chief Science Officer of Cortical Labs, states that this technology is revolutionary for disease modelling, drug testing and artificial intelligence research.</p>
                <h2>What are the Advantages of CL1?</h2>
                    <p>Compared to traditional artificial intelligence systems, the biggest advantages of CL1 are as follows:
                    
                    Energy Efficiency: CL1 consumes only a few watts of energy. Traditional artificial intelligence systems consume 850-1000 watts.
                    Learning Ability: Since it consists of human brain cells, the learning process is much faster and adaptability is high.
                    More Dynamic and Flexible: Biological neural networks offer a more flexible and sustainable working model than classical artificial intelligence algorithms.
                    Cortical Labs plans to offer this technology to the masses with a cloud-based platform. Users will be able to work with these biological computers via the cloud instead of buying a physical device.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Biological Intelligence Operating System: biOS</h2>
                    <p>One of the most important components of CL1 is the ‘Biological Intelligence Operating System’ (biOS). Thanks to this operating system:
                    
                    <li>Users can interact directly with neurons.</li>
                   <li>They can perform information operations by sending code.</li>
                    <li>The system uses special algorithms that manage biological neural networks.</li>
                    <li>In addition, the life support mechanisms inside the CL1 can keep neurons alive for six months.</li></p>
                    
                    <h2>How Much Does CL1 Cost?</h2>
                    <p>The commercial version of CL1 will be available with a price tag of $ 35,000. It is planned to be made more widely available in the second half of 2025.
                    
                    Cortical Labs' ultimate goal is to develop the most advanced learning machines using these biological systems.</p>
